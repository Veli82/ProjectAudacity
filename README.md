## ProjectAudacity
This project was created for the Object-Oriented Programming course, taught by P. Armyanov at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University.

The project is a **software for sound editing**, very similar to and inspired by *Audacity*.

The catch is that the user interface is entirely *in the console*.

Some of the key features are:
* Importing sound from a `.wav` file format.
* Generating sounds (like a specific tone or white noise).
* Applying effects to sounds. (or only to a part of them).
* Support for editing multiple overlapping tracks.
* Exporting the modified sound in `.wav` file format, ready to be played.
* Saving the progress made in a binary file. (Save/Load project).

A visualization for the project is not available (yet), so you will have to remember the commands that you input.
